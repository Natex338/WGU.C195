•The Purpose of this program is to provide a scheduling application that can be run in multiple regions and languages, currently
the only supported languages are english and French. The scheduling app is purposed to only allow appointments during normal
Business hours of 8am to 10 pm EST. 

• To run the program you must log in with user credentials, once logged in the display will show you all current appointments.
Buttons and toggles on the top and right of the gui allow you to view clients, sort appointments by month, week and view all.
You can add appointments / and clients in their respective screens. Deleting a client will check if they have appointments and prompt
you to cancel appointments before deletion.
